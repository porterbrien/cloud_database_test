# Overview

I want to be able to create databases whenever I want to so that when there is a chance to make a program that needs a database, I will be able to implement it into the code.

I wrote a script that takes usernames, passwords and phone numbers. The program then saves the user's data into the database. if they want to access their account, they can anytime they want.

# Cloud Database

The cloud database that I decided to use was mySQL which is just a basic open source relational database engine. Its used to store, organize, and retreive data.

Its a very simple structure. I only have one data table currently. but in this table, the customerID is the primary key and the foregin keys are the usernames, passwords, and phonenumbers.

some tools that I used for this assignment was Youtube, SQL Workbench, ChatGPT, and my friend Ben who helped me understand SQL querries.

I just used python and imported mysql.connector which is supposed to help
